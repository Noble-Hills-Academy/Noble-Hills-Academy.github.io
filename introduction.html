            Students in the middle and high school are not only engaged in their education, but are at the precipice of having to make life decisions. Giving students the proper tools for success not only in the classroom, but outside of the classroom is very important. The faculty and staff at NHA are of the highest caliber.  Our teachers are able to deliver relevant content as well as to serve as mentors and role models. All the members of our campus team are dedicated to making every student’s educational experience unique and meaningful.
